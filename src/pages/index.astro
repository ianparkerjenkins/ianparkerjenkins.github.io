  <h1>Ian Jenkins</h1>

  <p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:1.1rem;">
    Senior Software Engineer working at the intersection of
    scientific computing, automation, and applied machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I design and build software systems for complex, real-world
    problems — particularly where correctness, performance, and
    long-term maintainability matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    My background includes quantum control software, data pipelines,
    and building tools that help people reason about uncertainty,
    tradeoffs, and long-term outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I prefer simple, well-reasoned systems over clever ones.</li>
    <li>I optimize for clarity, reliability, and leverage.</li>
    <li>I enjoy working close to both theory and real constraints.</li>
  </ul>
